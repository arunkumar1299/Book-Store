# Book Store MERN stack project

Hello Guys, I have developed a full-stack Bookstore application using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack with the help of freeCodeCamp.

For backend:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Built a robust Node.js backend with MongoDB and Mongoose.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Created, read, updated, and deleted book records via RESTful APIs.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Utilized Express.js routers for backend organization.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Implemented CORS policy for secure frontend-backend communication.

For Frontend:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Set up a React project with Vite and Tailwind CSS.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Implemented Single Page Application (SPA) architecture with React Router DOM.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Developed intuitive UI for listing, viewing, adding, editing, and deleting books.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Enhanced user experience with stylish alerts and modularized components.
üîπ I have learned in knowledge about MERN stack development, database modeling, RESTful API design, and UI/UX enhancements.
